# U.S.-Geological-Survey-Recent-Earthquakes

In this project, I visualized earthquake data from the past 30 days from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). This data is updated every 5 minutes.

Leaflet was used to plot all earthquakes in the last 30 days, based on their latitude and longitude. In both size and color, the markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake they represent. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger in size and darker in color. When clicked, the markers produce a popup highlighting the location, magnitude, and date & time of earthquake.
